- Install **Node.js** and **npm** (comes with Node.js).
- Install **Visual Studio Code** (VSCode).
- Install VSCode extensions for React development: ESLint, Prettier, Reactjs code snippets.

## 2. Create Your React App

- Open VSCode and create a new folder for your project.
- Open a terminal in VSCode and run:

npx create-react-app my-app

- This creates a new React application named `my-app`.

## 3. Run Your React App

- Navigate to your project folder in the terminal and start the app:

cd my-app

npm start

- Your default web browser should open with your running React app.

## 4. Connect to GitHub

- Authenticate with GitHub.
- Add your authorization token manually.
- Verify your GitHub connection.
- Initialize a new Git repository in your project folder:

git init

- Add all your project files to the repository:

git add .

- Commit the changes:

git commit -m "Initial commit"

- Create a branch main

git branch -M main

- Create a new repository on GitHub and copy its URL (your-github-repo-url)

Note: Can follow Quick Start after create new repository on GitHub

OR

- Link your local repository to the GitHub repository:

Repalce your-github-repo-url and run this command:

git remote add origin your-github-repo-url

- Push your code to GitHub:

git push -u origin main

- When adding new file, help.md for example
